A set of scripts for the 4th Domain Project.

These scripts are, for the most part, very rough code to manage data
--which is mostly in the form of sequences and name/aliases--and to
run applications on the High Powered Computing Center (HPCC) at MSU.

Eventually scripts should be fairly well commented and work
universally, but that will probably never happen.  I'll be happy at
75% of that goal.
